## Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Module 20 Challenge


#### Project Overiew
With skills learned in this module regarding machine learning and neural networks to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting if applicants will 
be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Using the provided CSV to preprocess data for a neural network model, compile and train the model, and finally create an 
optimized version of the first model created. along with the written analysis (README.md)


#### Deliverables
1. Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. Optimize the Model
4. A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)


#### Results
